    <h1>Welcome to Meimei Studio</h1>
    <p>This is a prototype showcasing one of my recent projects, utilizing the latest HTML and CSS technologies. It was a school project where I collaborated with three teammates. We used Figma to design the site with the goal of creating an elegant website for a car leasing company.</p>
    <h2>Web Design Process:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Design</strong>: Created the look and feel in Figma, ensuring itâ€™s mobile, tablet, and desktop-friendly.</li>
        <li><strong>Development</strong>: Used Visual Studio to write the code based on the Figma design.</li>
    </ol>
