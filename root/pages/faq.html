			<h1>Vehicle Leasing FAQs</h1>

        <h2>Making car leasing easy</h2>

        <h3>Finance</h3>
      
	      <details>
		    <summary>Do I need a credit check for car leasing?</summary>
		    <p>Yes, a credit check is typically required when leasing a vehicle. This involves a creditor examining your financial information by accessing your credit report to assess your reliability as a borrower and ensure your ability to meet monthly payments for the vehicle. The credit check generates a credit report, offering an overview of your financial history.</p>
	      </details>

	      <details>
		    <summary>Who provides the finance?</summary>
		    <p>By partnering with major vehicle finance providers in the UK, we gain access to exclusive offers and special discounts, enabling us to ensure highly competitive rates and provide a range of tailored finance products to suit your individual requirements.</p>
	      </details>

	      <details>
		    <summary>Is Employment necessary to lease a vehicle?</summary>
		    <p>While your income is considered during the finance application process, employment is not essential for a lease agreement. There are various finance options catering to a diverse range of individuals, including retirees, part-time employees, and those who are self-employed. </p>
	      </details>

	      <details>
		    <summary>Can my business be eligible for finance?</summary>
		    <p>In order to lease a vehicle for your business, a credit check is mandatory, regardless of whether it's for a car or a commercial vehicle. Businesses with less than two years of trading or limited financial history may find it challenging to secure vehicle finance, as the finance provider may have difficulty objectively assessing the business and potential lending risks. </p>

        <h3>Selecting a new vehicle</h3>
      
	      <details>
		    <summary>Are all the vehicles you provide brand new?</summary>
		    <p>Certainly! Every vehicle we offer is brand new and sourced directly from dealerships. We have established strong relationships with top suppliers across the UK, allowing our pricing team to guarantee the best lease deals available.</p>
	      </details>

	      <details>
		    <summary>Are insurance costs included in lease deals on your website?</summary>
		    <p>Unfortunately, our lease agreements do not include insurance coverage, so it is your responsibility to make sure the vehicle is fully insured.</p>
	      </details>

	      <details>
		    <summary>Could you provide information on the most budget-friendly vehicles available?</summary>
		    <p>We are dedicated to offering a diverse selection of budget-friendly car lease deals and cost-effective leasing options. Our range encompasses various makes and models, allowing you to find an affordable car that aligns with your preferences and budget. </p>
	      </details>

	      <details>
		    <summary>What distinctions exist between "In Stock" and "Factory Order"?</summary>
		    <p>An "in-stock" car refers to a vehicle that is already present at the dealership and ready to be delivered. 
          Factory Order:
          On the other hand, a "factory order" involves choosing a car directly from the manufacturer. This process typically takes longer than acquiring an in-stock car.</p>

        <h3>Leasing a Vehicle</h3>
      
	      <details>
		    <summary>Am I allowed to bring my vehicle abroad?</summary>

	      <details>
		    <summary>Can I Trade in My Current Vehicle?</summary>
